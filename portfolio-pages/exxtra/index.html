                A large amount of inspiration was derived from companies that specialise in process/service. 
                Initial concepts of exxtralife as a brand stemmed from it being a subsidiary of an almost dystopian hyper-capitalist corporation, 
                like a bank or a city state, with exxtralife being the entertainment sector. 
                It was only natural to draw from public transportation and its process focused organisations. 
                A public transportation system can almost be judged solely off of its iconography, its legibility. 
                MTA in New York and the London Underground are perfect examples of this. 
                <br><br> This leads us to the national rail symbol. A cultural institution with a symbol that is immediately recognisable. 
                It is also a symbol of hyper-capitalism in its own way. With it only coming about after the privatisation of British rail networks during the late 90s, 
                making it the perfect icon to absorb into the symbology of exxtralife.

                <br><br>The tokenisation of the symbols in the exxtralife logo point to a pop art like reductionist view of pop culture, 
                melding the iconography of video games, and organisations important for daily function together as one. 

                This direction is what has been used to inform artistic and creative choices in regard to web design, posters and marketing decisions.
